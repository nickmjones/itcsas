				<a href="https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?OrderBy=state&Sort=ASC/">Find your Senator</a> and tell them Ted Cruz's <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/07/ted-cruz-riot-capitol/" target="_blank">efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election</a>, thereby dignifying the violent January 6th Insurrection with credibility, should have consequences.

				While you're there, tell them Sen. Josh Hawley is also a fascist twerp who thinks he can give the <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/senator-josh-hawley-photo-capitol-trump-supporters/63-3b5d7611-9d07-41bd-8113-a9ccf74ebb68" target="_blank">solidarity fist to armed insurrectionists one day</a> and preach for "unity" the next. He, too, voted to overturn the results of a free and fair election, citing bogus and repeatedly debunked claims of "election irregularities".
			</p>
			
			<p>
				"Election irregularity" is Republican code for "too many black and brown people voted and we want a do-over so we can make sure our thumb is on the scale".
				<p>
			
			<p>
				Cruz and Hawley should be shamed and expelled from the Senate.
